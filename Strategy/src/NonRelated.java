/*
Suppose you are the team lead of the team making FIFA 2021,a football simulation video game.You want to add a feature in the game,
which will allow customers to build a football player from scratch.The customers can customize the look of that player but cannot
customize skills of that player.For the sake of simplicity lets say the player mainly has two skills.

1)A player can run.He can run definitely:
    i)Run like an amature ii)Run like a Pro iii)Run like CR7 ... etc.
2)A player can kick the ball too.He can kick the ball differently like
    i)Run like an amature ii)Run like a Pro iii)Run like Devid Bekham ... etc.
    There is aloso another skill,Dribbling.This one is reserved for the best of the best.A player can
    i)Dribble like a Pro ii)Dribble like Ronaldino iii)Dribble like Messi.

When a player is created,initially he can
    Run like an amature
    KIck like an amature
    Can't Dribble
As the customer plays with the player,scores goals or simply pays you some money,you will update the skill of that player.
So,it is possible that after playing some days(or the customer gives you some money) the player can
    Run like CR7
    Kick like Bekham
    Dribble like Ronaldinho


How you will design the codebase for your game?What is your strategy?(SHow the code stucture only)
